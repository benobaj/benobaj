 In this post I will go though the code for a simple data dashboard that visualizes the Iris dataset. 
 It features two dropdown menus and three checkboxes. The dropdown menus choose the features on the x and y axes, 
 while the checkboxes make samples visible or invisible based on their species. 
 Below is a screenshot and a video of the dashboard. 
 Before I start with the code I give a brief rational for using ipywidgets and Bokeh.
